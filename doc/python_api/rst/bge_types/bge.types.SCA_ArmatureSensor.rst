SCA_ArmatureSensor(SCA_ISensor)
===============================

.. currentmodule:: bge.types

base class --- :class:`~bge.types.SCA_ISensor`

.. class:: SCA_ArmatureSensor

   Armature sensor detect conditions on armatures.

   .. attribute:: type

      The type of measurement that the sensor make when it is active.

      Can be one of :ref:`these constants <armaturesensor-type>`

      :type: integer.

   .. attribute:: constraint

      The constraint object this sensor is watching.

      :type: :class:`~bge.types.BL_ArmatureConstraint`

   .. attribute:: value

      The threshold used in the comparison with the constraint error
      The linear error is only updated on CopyPose/Distance IK constraint with iTaSC solver
      The rotation error is only updated on CopyPose+rotation IK constraint with iTaSC solver
      The linear error on CopyPose is always >= 0: it is the norm of the distance between the target and the bone
      The rotation error on CopyPose is always >= 0: it is the norm of the equivalent rotation vector between the bone and the target orientations
      The linear error on Distance can be positive if the distance between the bone and the target is greater than the desired distance, and negative if the distance is smaller.

      :type: float
