.. currentmodule:: bge.types

base class --- :class:`~bge.types.EXP_PyObjectPlus`

.. class:: SCA_PythonJoystick

   A Python interface to a joystick.

   .. attribute:: name

      The name assigned to the joystick by the operating system. (read-only)

      :type: string

   .. attribute:: activeButtons

      A list of active button values. (read-only)

      :type: list

   .. attribute:: axisValues

      The state of the joysticks axis as a list of values :attr:`numAxis` long. (read-only).

      :type: list of ints.

      Each specifying the value of an axis between -1.0 and 1.0
      depending on how far the axis is pushed, 0 for nothing.
      The first 2 values are used by most joysticks and gamepads for directional control.
      3rd and 4th values are only on some joysticks and can be used for arbitary controls.

      * left:[-1.0, 0.0, ...]
      * right:[1.0, 0.0, ...]
      * up:[0.0, -1.0, ...]
      * down:[0.0, 1.0, ...]
