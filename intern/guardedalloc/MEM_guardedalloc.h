 *
 * \subsection memabout About the MEM allocator module
 *
 * MEM provides guarded memory management. All allocated memory is enclosed by pads, to detect
 * out-of-bound writes. All blocks are placed in a linked list, so they remain reachable at all
 * times. There is no back-up in case the linked-list related data is lost.
 *
 * It provides C++ template versions of the `new`/`delete` operators (#MEM_new and #MEM_delete),
 * which are the preferred way to create and delete data in new C++ code.
 *
 * It also provides C++ template versions of [cm]alloc and related API, which provides improved
 * type safety, ensures that the allocated types are trivial, and reduces the casting verbosity by
 * directly returning a pointer of the expected type. These are the preferred API when C++ code
 * needs to allocate or free data in a C-compatible way (e.g. because it needs to interact with
 * other 'legacy' code using C-based memory management).
 *
 * Finally, the original C-compatible, type-agnostic allocation API (#MEM_mallocN, #MEM_freeN,
 * etc.) is kept for a few specific use-cases. Its usage should be avoided as much as possible.
