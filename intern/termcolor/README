    ~ What is termcolor?

      Termcolor is a header-only C++ library for printing colored
      messages to the terminal. Written just for fun with a help of
      the Force.

      And yeah, it's BSD licensed so you are free to do whatever you
      want as long as copyright sticks around!


    ~ How to use?

      Add `termcolor.hpp` to the project and use provided stream
      manimulators from the `termcolor` namespace.

      For example:

          std::cout << termcolor::red << termcolor::on_blue
                    << "Red text on blue background!"
                    << termcolor::reset << std::endl;

      Please, don't forgot to reset termcolor's settings on the stream!


    ~ What terminals are supported?

      Termcolor supports ANSI color formatting. This formatting is
      supported by most popular terminals on Linux, Unix and Mac OS.
      On Windows, WinAPI is used instead, however, some limitations
      are applied. Check the docs for details!
