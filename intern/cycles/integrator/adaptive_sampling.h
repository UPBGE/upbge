   * missing any filtering point. This means that the result is "clamped" by the nearest sample
   * at which filtering is needed. This is part of mechanism which ensures that all devices will

   * if the number of samples is 1, then the path tracer will render samples [align_samples],
   * if the number of samples is 2, then the path tracer will render samples [align_samples,
   * align_samples + 1] and so on. */
