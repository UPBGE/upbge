  /* IDropTarget implementation
   * + The IDropTarget interface is one of the interfaces you implement to
   *   provide drag-and-drop operations in your application. It contains methods
   *   used in any application that can be a target for data during a
   *   drag-and-drop operation. A drop-target application is responsible for:
   *
   *  - Determining the effect of the drop on the target application.
   *  - Incorporating any valid dropped data when the drop occurs.
   *  - Communicating target feedback to the source so the source application
   *    can provide appropriate visual feedback such as setting the cursor.
   *  - Implementing drag scrolling.
   *  - Registering and revoking its application windows as drop targets.
   *
   * The IDropTarget interface contains methods that handle all these
   * responsibilities except registering and revoking the application window
   * as a drop target, for which you must call the RegisterDragDrop and the
   * RevokeDragDrop functions.
