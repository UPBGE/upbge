//   TEST(FooTest, LogsCorrectly) {
//     ScopedMockLog log;
//
//     // We expect the WARNING "Something bad!" exactly twice.
//     EXPECT_CALL(log, Log(WARNING, _, "Something bad!"))
//         .Times(2);
//
//     // We allow foo.cc to call LOG(INFO) any number of times.
//     EXPECT_CALL(log, Log(INFO, HasSubstr("/foo.cc"), _))
//         .Times(AnyNumber());
//
//     Foo();  // Exercises the code under test.

  // be running simultaneously, we ensure thread-safety of the exchange between
  // send() and WaitTillSent(), and that for each message, LOG(), send(),
  // WaitTillSent() and Log() are executed in the same thread.
