    UPBGE is an open-source 3D game engine forked from old Blender Game Engine,
    deployed with Blender itself. This unified workflow is its main strength as
    you can make your game from start to end without leave UPBGE.

    This way you will be able to increase your productivity incredibly.
    You will be a one man army!!!

    The standard snap channels are used in the following way:

           stable - Latest stable release.
        candidate - Test builds for the upcoming stable release.
