/**
 * For evaluation, geometry node groups are converted to a lazy-function graph. The generated graph
 * is cached per node group, so it only has to be generated once after a change.
 *
 * Node groups are *not* inlined into the lazy-function graph. This could be added in the future as
 * it might improve performance in some cases, but generally does not seem necessary. Inlining node
 * groups also has disadvantages like making per-node-group caches less useful, resulting in more
 * overhead.
 *
 * Instead, group nodes are just like all other nodes in the lazy-function graph. What makes them
 * special is that they reference the lazy-function graph of the group they reference.
 *
 * During lazy-function graph generation, a mapping between the #bNodeTree and
 * #lazy_function::Graph is build that can be used when evaluating the graph (e.g. for logging).
