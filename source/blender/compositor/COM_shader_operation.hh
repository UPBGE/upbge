 * Shader Operation
 *
 * A pixel operation that evaluates a shader compiled from the pixel compile unit using the GPU
 * material compiler, see GPU_material.hh for more information. Also see the PixelOperation class
 * for more information on pixel operations.
 *
 * An input to the pixel operation is declared for a distinct output socket as follows:
 *
 * - A texture is added to the shader, which will be bound to the result of the output socket
 *   during evaluation.
 * - A GPU attribute is added to the GPU material for that output socket and is linked to the GPU
 *   input stack of the inputs linked to the output socket.
 * - Code is emitted to initialize the values of the attributes by sampling the textures
 *   corresponding to each of the inputs.
 * - The newly added attribute is mapped to the output socket in output_to_material_attribute_map_
 *   to share that same attributes for all inputs linked to the same output socket.
 *
 * An output to the pixel operation is declared for an output socket as follows:
 *
 * - An image is added in the shader where the output value will be written.
 * - A storer GPU material node that stores the value of the output is added and linked to the GPU
 *   output stack of the output. The storer will store the value in the image identified by the
 *   index of the output given to the storer.
 * - The storer functions are generated dynamically to map each index with its appropriate image.
 *
 * The GPU material code generator source is used to construct a compute shader that is then
 * dispatched during operation evaluation after binding the inputs, outputs, and any necessary
 * resources. */
