/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Evaluator
 *
 * The evaluator is the main class of the compositor and the entry point of its execution. The
 * evaluator compiles the compositor node tree and evaluates it to compute its output. It is
 * constructed from a compositor node tree and a compositor context. Upon calling the evaluate
 * method, the evaluator will check if the node tree is already compiled into an operations stream,
 * and if it is, it will go over it and evaluate the operations in order. It is then the
 * responsibility of the caller to call the reset method when the node tree changes to invalidate
 * the operations stream. A reset is also required if the resources used by the node tree change,
 * for instances, when the dimensions of an image used by the node tree changes. This is necessary
 * because the evaluator compiles the node tree into an operations stream that is specifically
 * optimized for the structure of the resources used by the node tree.
 *
 * Otherwise, if the node tree is not yet compiled, the evaluator will compile it into an
 * operations stream, evaluating the operations in the process. It should be noted that operations
 * are evaluated as soon as they are compiled, as opposed to compiling the whole operations stream
 * and then evaluating it in a separate step. This is important because, as mentioned before, the
 * operations stream is optimized specifically for the structure of the resources used by the node
 * tree, which is only known after the operations are evaluated. In other words, the evaluator uses
 * the evaluated results of previously compiled operations to compile the operations that follow
 * them in an optimized manner.
 *
 * Compilation starts by computing an optimized node execution schedule by calling the
 * compute_schedule function, see the discussion in COM_scheduler.hh for more details. For the node
 * tree shown below, the execution schedule is denoted by the node numbers. The compiler then goes
 * over the execution schedule in order and compiles each node into either a Node Operation or a
 * Shader Operation, depending on the node type, see the is_shader_node function. A Shader
 * operation is constructed from a group of nodes forming a contiguous subset of the node execution
 * schedule. For instance, in the node tree shown below, nodes 3 and 4 are compiled together into a
 * shader operation and node 5 is compiled into its own shader operation, both of which are
 * contiguous subsets of the node execution schedule. This process is described in details in the
 * following section.

 * For non shader nodes, the compilation process is straight forward, the compiler instantiates a
 * node operation from the node, map its inputs to the results of the outputs they are linked to,
 * and evaluates the operations. However, for shader nodes, since a group of nodes can be compiled
 * together into a shader operation, the compilation process is a bit involved. The compiler uses
 * an instance of the Compile State class to keep track of the compilation process. The compiler
 * state stores the so called "shader compile unit", which is the current group of nodes that will
 * eventually be compiled together into a shader operation. While going over the schedule, the
 * compiler adds the shader nodes to the compile unit until it decides that the compile unit is
 * complete and should be compiled. This is typically decided when the current node is not
 * compatible with the compile unit and can't be added to it, only then it compiles the compile
 * unit into a shader operation and resets it to ready it to track the next potential group of
 * nodes that will form a shader operation. This decision is made based on various criteria in the
 * should_compile_shader_compile_unit function. See the discussion in COM_compile_state.hh for more
 * details of those criteria, but perhaps the most evident of which is whether the node is actually
 * a shader node, if it isn't, then it evidently can't be added to the compile unit and the compile
 * unit is should be compiled.
 *
 * For the node tree above, the compilation process is as follows. The compiler goes over the node
 * execution schedule in order considering each node. Nodes 1 and 2 are not shader node so they are
 * compiled into node operations and added to the operations stream. The current compile unit is
 * empty, so it is not compiled. Node 3 is a shader node, and since the compile unit is currently
 * empty, it is unconditionally added to it. Node 4 is a shader node, it was decided---for the sake
 * of the demonstration---that it is compatible with the compile unit and can be added to it. Node
 * 5 is a shader node, but it was decided---for the sake of the demonstration---that it is not
 * compatible with the compile unit, so the compile unit is considered complete and is compiled
 * first, adding the first shader operation to the operations stream and resetting the compile
 * unit. Node 5 is then added to the now empty compile unit similar to node 3. Node 6 is not a
 * shader node, so the compile unit is considered complete and is compiled first, adding the first
 * shader operation to the operations stream and resetting the compile unit. Finally, node 6 is
 * compiled into a node operation similar to nodes 1 and 2 and added to the operations stream. */
