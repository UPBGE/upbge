/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Shader Operation
 *
 * An operation that evaluates a shader compiled from a contiguous subset of the node execution
 * schedule using the GPU material compiler, see GPU_material.h for more information. The subset
 * of the node execution schedule is called a shader compile unit, see the discussion in
 * COM_compile_state.hh for more information.
 *
 * Consider the following node graph with a node execution schedule denoted by the number on each
 * node. The compiler may decide to compile a subset of the execution schedule into a shader
 * operation, in this case, the nodes from 3 to 5 were compiled together into a shader operation.
 * This subset is called the shader compile unit. See the discussion in COM_evaluator.hh for more
 * information on the compilation process. Each of the nodes inside the compile unit implements a
 * Shader Node which is instantiated, stored in shader_nodes_, and used during compilation. See the
 * discussion in COM_shader_node.hh for more information. Links that are internal to the shader
 * operation are established between the input and outputs of the shader nodes, for instance, the
 * links between nodes 3 and 4 as well as those between nodes 4 and 5. However, links that cross
 * the boundary of the shader operation needs special handling.
 *

 * Links from nodes that are not part of the shader operation to nodes that are part of the shader
 * operation are considered inputs of the operation itself and are declared as such. For instance,
 * the link from node 1 to node 3 is declared as an input to the operation, and the same applies
 * for the links from node 2 to nodes 3 and 5. Note, however, that only one input is declared for
 * each distinct output socket, so both links from node 2 share the same input of the operation.
 * An input to the operation is declared for a distinct output socket as follows:
 *
 * - A texture is added to the shader, which will be bound to the result of the output socket
 *   during evaluation.
 * - A GPU attribute is added to the GPU material for that output socket and is linked to the GPU
 *   input stack of the inputs linked to the output socket.
 * - Code is emitted to initialize the values of the attributes by sampling the textures
 *   corresponding to each of the inputs.
 * - The newly added attribute is mapped to the output socket in output_to_material_attribute_map_
 *   to share that same attributes for all inputs linked to the same output socket.
 *
 * Links from nodes that are part of the shader operation to nodes that are not part of the shader
 * operation are considered outputs of the operation itself and are declared as such. For instance,
 * the link from node 5 to node 6 is declared as an output to the operation. An output to the
 * operation is declared for an output socket as follows:
 *
 * - An image is added in the shader where the output value will be written.
 * - A storer GPU material node that stores the value of the output is added and linked to the GPU
 *   output stack of the output. The storer will store the value in the image identified by the
 *   index of the output given to the storer.
 * - The storer functions are generated dynamically to map each index with its appropriate image.
 *
 * The GPU material code generator source is used to construct a compute shader that is then
 * dispatched during operation evaluation after binding the inputs, outputs, and any necessary
 * resources. */
