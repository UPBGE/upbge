 *

 * necessary data and functionalities for the correct operation of the evaluator. This includes
 * providing input data like render passes and the active scene, as well as references to the data
 * where the output of the evaluator will be written. The class also provides a reference to the
 * texture pool which should be implemented by the caller and provided during construction.
 * Finally, the class have an instance of a static shader manager and a static resource manager
 * for acquiring cached shaders and resources efficiently. */
