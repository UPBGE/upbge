/* The Morphological Distance Feather operation is a linear combination between the result of two
 * operations. The first operation is a Gaussian blur with a radius equivalent to the dilate/erode
 * distance, which is straightforward and implemented as a separable filter similar to the blur
 * operation.
 *
 * The second operation is an approximation of a morphological inverse distance operation evaluated
 * at a distance falloff function. The result of a morphological inverse distance operation is a
 * narrow band distance field that starts at its maximum value at boundaries where a difference in
 * values took place and linearly deceases until it reaches zero in the span of a number of pixels
 * equivalent to the erode/dilate distance. Additionally, instead of linearly decreasing, the user
 * may choose a different falloff which is evaluated at the computed distance. For dilation, the
 * distance field decreases outwards, and for erosion, the distance field decreased inwards.
 *
 * The reason why the result of a Gaussian blur is mixed in with the distance field is because the
 * distance field is merely approximated and not accurately computed, the defects of which is more
 * apparent away from boundaries and especially at corners where the distance field should take a
 * circular shape. That's why the Gaussian blur is mostly mixed only further from boundaries.
 *
 * The morphological inverse distance operation is approximated using a separable implementation
 * and intertwined with the Gaussian blur implementation as follows. A search window of a radius
 * equivalent to the dilate/erode distance is applied on the image to find either the minimum or
 * maximum pixel value multiplied by its corresponding falloff value in the window. For dilation,
 * we try to find the maximum, and for erosion, we try to find the minimum. The implementation uses
 * an inverse function to find the minimum. Additionally, we also save the falloff value where the
 * minimum or maximum was found. The found value will be that of the narrow band distance field and
 * the saved falloff value will be used as the mixing factor with the Gaussian blur.
 *
 * To make sense of the aforementioned algorithm, assume we are dilating a binary image by 5 pixels
 * whose half has a value of 1 and the other half has a value of zero. Consider the following:
 *
 * - A pixel of value 1 already has the maximum possible value, so its value will remain unchanged
 *   regardless of its position.
 * - A pixel of value 0 that is right at the boundary of the 1's region will have a maximum value
 *   of around 0.8 depending on the falloff. That's because the search window intersects the 1's
 *   region, which when multiplied by the falloff gives the first value of the falloff, which is
 *   larger than the initially zero value computed at the center of the search window.
 * - A pixel of value 0 that is 3 pixels away from the boundary will have a maximum value of around
 *   0.4 depending on the falloff. That's because the search window intersects the 1's region,
 *   which when multiplied by the falloff gives the third value of the falloff, which is larger
 *   than the initially zero value computed at the center of the search window.
 * - Finally, a pixel of value 0 that is 6 pixels away from the boundary will have a maximum value
 *   of 0, because the search window doesn't intersects the 1's region and only spans zero values.
 *
 * The previous example demonstrates how the distance field naturally arises, and the same goes for
 * the erode case, except the minimum value is computed instead. */
