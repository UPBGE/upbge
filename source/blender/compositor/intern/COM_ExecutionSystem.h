/**
 * \page execution Execution model
 * In order to get to an efficient model for execution, several steps are being done. these steps
 * are explained below.
 *
 * \section EM_Step1 Step 1: translating blender node system to the new compositor system
 * Blenders node structure is based on C structs (DNA). These structs are not efficient in the new
 * architecture. We want to use classes in order to simplify the system. during this step the
 * blender node_tree is evaluated and converted to a CPP node system.
 *
 * \see ExecutionSystem
 * \see Converter.convert
 * \see Node
 *
 * \section EM_Step2 Step2: translating nodes to operations
 * Ungrouping the GroupNodes. Group nodes are node_tree's in node_tree's.
 * The new system only supports a single level of node_tree.
 * We will 'flatten' the system in a single level.
 * \see GroupNode
 * \see ExecutionSystemHelper.ungroup
 *
 * Every node has the ability to convert itself to operations. The node itself is responsible to
 * create a correct NodeOperation setup based on its internal settings. Most Node only need to
 * convert it to its NodeOperation. Like a ColorToBWNode doesn't check anything, but replaces
 * itself with a ConvertColorToBWOperation. More complex nodes can use different NodeOperation
 * based on settings; like MixNode. based on the selected Mixtype a different operation will be
 * used. for more information see the page about creating new Nodes. [@subpage newnode]
 *
 * \see ExecutionSystem.convert_to_operations
 * \see Node.convert_to_operations
 * \see NodeOperation base class for all operations in the system
 *
 * \section EM_Step3 Step3: add additional conversions to the operation system
 *   - Data type conversions: the system has 3 data types DataType::Value, DataType::Vector,
 * DataType::Color. The user can connect a Value socket to a color socket. As values are ordered
 * differently than colors a conversion happens.
 *
 *   - Image size conversions: the system can automatically convert when resolutions do not match.
 *     An NodeInput has a resize mode. This can be any of the following settings.
 *     - [@ref InputSocketResizeMode.ResizeMode::Center]:
 *       The center of both images are aligned
 *     - [@ref InputSocketResizeMode.ResizeMode::FitWidth]:
 *       The width of both images are aligned
 *     - [@ref InputSocketResizeMode.ResizeMode::FitHeight]:
 *       The height of both images are aligned
 *     - [@ref InputSocketResizeMode.ResizeMode::FitAny]:
 *       The width, or the height of both images are aligned to make sure that it fits.
 *     - [@ref InputSocketResizeMode.ResizeMode::Stretch]:
 *       The width and the height of both images are aligned.
 *     - [@ref InputSocketResizeMode.ResizeMode::None]:
 *       Bottom left of the images are aligned.
 *
 * \see COM_convert_data_type Datatype conversions
 * \see Converter.convert_resolution Image size conversions
 *
 * \section EM_Step4 Step4: group operations in executions groups
 * ExecutionGroup are groups of operations that are calculated as being one bigger operation.
 * All operations will be part of an ExecutionGroup.
 * Complex nodes will be added to separate groups. Between ExecutionGroup's the data will be stored
 * in MemoryBuffers. ReadBufferOperations and WriteBufferOperations are added where needed.
