/* Compute a heuristic estimation of the number of intermediate buffers needed to compute each node
 * and all of its dependencies for all nodes that the given node depends on. The output is a map
 * that maps each node with the number of intermediate buffers needed to compute it and all of its
 * dependencies.
 *
 * Consider a node that takes n number of buffers as an input from a number of node dependencies,
 * which we shall call the input nodes. The node also computes and outputs m number of buffers.
 * In order for the node to compute its output, a number of intermediate buffers will be needed.
 * Since the node takes n buffers and outputs m buffers, then the number of buffers directly
 * needed by the node is (n + m). But each of the input buffers are computed by a node that, in
 * turn, needs a number of buffers to compute its output. So the total number of buffers needed
 * to compute the output of the node is max(n + m, d) where d is the number of buffers needed by
 * the input node that needs the largest number of buffers. We only consider the input node that
 * needs the largest number of buffers, because those buffers can be reused by any input node
 * that needs a lesser number of buffers.
 *
 * Pixel nodes, however, are a special case because links between two pixel nodes inside the same
 * pixel operation don't pass a buffer, but a single value in the pixel processor. So for pixel
 * nodes, only inputs and outputs linked to nodes that are not pixel nodes should be considered.
 * Note that this might not actually be true, because the compiler may decide to split a pixel
 * operation into multiples ones that will pass buffers, but this is not something that can be
 * known at scheduling-time. See the discussion in COM_compile_state.hh, COM_evaluator.hh, and
 * COM_shader_operation.hh for more information. In the node tree shown below, node 4 will have
 * exactly the same number of needed buffers by node 3, because its inputs and outputs are all
 * internally linked in the pixel operation.

 * Note that the computed output is not guaranteed to be accurate, and will not be in most cases.
 * The computation is merely a heuristic estimation that works well in most cases. This is due to a
 * number of reasons:
 * - The node tree is actually a graph that allows output sharing, which is not something that was
 *   taken into consideration in this implementation because it is difficult to correctly consider.
 * - Each node may allocate any number of internal buffers, which is not taken into account in this
 *   implementation because it rarely affects the output and is done by very few nodes.
 * - The compiler may decide to compiler the schedule differently depending on runtime information
 *   which we can merely speculate at scheduling-time as described above. */
