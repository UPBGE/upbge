/**
 * \brief The BokehImageOperation class is an operation that creates an image useful to mimic the
 *internals of a camera.
 *
 * features:
 *  - number of flaps
 *  - angle offset of the flaps
 *  - rounding of the flaps (also used to make a circular lens)
 *  - simulate catadioptric
 *  - simulate lens-shift
 *
 * Per pixel the algorithm determines the edge of the bokeh on the same line as the center of the
 *image and the pixel is evaluating.
 *
 * The edge is detected by finding the closest point on the direct line between the two nearest
 *flap-corners. this edge is interpolated with a full circle. Result of this edge detection is
 *stored as the distance between the center of the image and the edge.
 *
 * catadioptric lenses are simulated to interpolate between the center of the image and the
 *distance of the edge. We now have three distances:
 *  - distance between the center of the image and the pixel to be evaluated
 *  - distance between the center of the image and the outer-edge
 *  - distance between the center of the image and the inner-edge
 *
 * With a simple compare it can be detected if the evaluated pixel is between the outer and inner
 *edge.
