/**
 * An #AnonymousAttributeID contains information about a specific anonymous attribute.
 * Like normal attributes, anonymous attributes are also identified by their name, so one should
 * not have to compare #AnonymousAttributeID pointers.
 *
 * Anonymous attributes don't need additional information besides their name, with a few
 * exceptions:
 * - The name of anonymous attributes is generated automatically, so it is generally not human
 *   readable (just random characters). #AnonymousAttributeID can provide more context as where a
 *   specific anonymous attribute was created which can simplify debugging.
 * - [Not yet supported.] When anonymous attributes are contained in on-disk caches, we have to map
 *   those back to anonymous attributes at run-time. The issue is that (for various reasons) we
 *   might change how anonymous attribute names are generated in the future, which would lead to a
 *   mis-match between stored and new attribute names. To work around it, we should cache
 *   additional information for anonymous attributes on disk (like which node created it). This
 *   information can then be used to map stored attributes to their run-time counterpart.
 *
 * Once created, #AnonymousAttributeID is immutable. Also it is intrinsically reference counted so
 * that it can have shared ownership. `std::shared_ptr` can't be used for that purpose here,
 * because that is not available in C code. If possible, the #AutoAnonymousAttributeID wrapper
 * should be used to avoid manual reference counting in C++ code.
