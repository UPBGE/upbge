/** \file
 * \ingroup bke
 *
 * API to manage data-blocks inside of Blender's Main data-base, or as independent runtime-only
 * data.
 *
 * \note `BKE_lib_` files are for operations over data-blocks themselves, although they might
 * alter Main as well (when creating/renaming/deleting an ID e.g.).
 *
 * \section Function Names
 *
 * \warning Descriptions below is ideal goal, current status of naming does not yet fully follow it
 * (this is WIP).
 *
 * - `BKE_lib_id_` should be used for rather high-level operations, that involve Main database and
 *   relations with other IDs, and can be considered as 'safe' (as in, in themselves, they leave
 *   affected IDs/Main in a consistent status).
 * - `BKE_lib_libblock_` should be used for lower level operations, that perform some parts of
 *   `BKE_lib_id_` ones, but will generally not ensure caller that affected data is in a consistent
 *   state by their own execution alone.
 * - `BKE_lib_main_` should be used for operations performed over all IDs of a given Main
 *   data-base.
 *
 * \note External code should typically not use `BKE_lib_libblock_` functions, except in some
 * specific cases requiring advanced (and potentially dangerous) handling.
