         *
         *  - User enters sculpt mode of the default cube object.
         *  - Sculpt mode creates new `layer`
         *  - User does some strokes.
         *  - User used undo until sculpt mode is exited.
         *
         * In an ideal world the sculpt mode will take care of keeping CustomData and CCG layers in
         * sync by doing proper pushes to a local sculpt undo stack.
         *
         * Since the proper solution needs time to be implemented, consider the target object
         * the source of truth of which data layers are to be updated during reshape. This means,
         * for example, that if the undo system says object does not have paint mask layer, it is
         * not to be updated.
         *
         * This is a fragile logic, and is only working correctly because the code path is only
         * used by sculpt changes. In other use cases the code might not catch inconsistency and
         * silently do wrong decision. */
