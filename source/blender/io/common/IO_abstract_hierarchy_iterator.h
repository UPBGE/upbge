 * This file contains the AbstractHierarchyIterator. It is intended for exporters for file
 * formats that concern an entire hierarchy of objects (rather than, for example, an OBJ file that
 * contains only a single mesh). Examples are Universal Scene Description (USD) and Alembic.
 * AbstractHierarchyIterator is intended to be subclassed to support concrete file formats.
 *
 * The AbstractHierarchyIterator makes a distinction between the actual object hierarchy and the
 * export hierarchy. The former is the parent/child structure in Blender, which can have multiple
 * parent-like objects. For example, a duplicated object can have both a duplicator and a parent,
 * both determining the final transform. The export hierarchy is the hierarchy as written to the
 * file, and every object has only one export-parent.
 *
 * Currently the AbstractHierarchyIterator does not make any decisions about *what* to export.
 * Selections like "selected only" or "no hair systems" are left to concrete subclasses.
