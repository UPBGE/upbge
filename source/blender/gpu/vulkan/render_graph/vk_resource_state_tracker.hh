 * The state of resources needs to be tracked on device level.
 *
 * The state that are being tracked include:
 * - Modification stamps: Each time a resource is modified, this stamp is increased. Inside the
 *   render graph nodes track the resources including this stamp.
 * - Image layouts: The layout of pixels of an image on the GPU depends on the command being
 *   executed. A certain `vkCmd*` requires the image to be in a certain layout. Using incorrect
 *   layouts could lead to rendering artifacts.
 * - Resource ownership: Resources that are externally managed (swap chain or external) uses a
 *   different workflow as its state can be altered externally and needs to be reset.
 * - Read/Write access masks: To generate correct and performing pipeline barriers the src/dst
 *   access masks needs to be accurate and precise. When creating pipeline barriers the resource
 *   usage up to that point should be known and the resource usage from that point on.
