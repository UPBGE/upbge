/* Metal Memory Manager Overview. */
/*
 * The Metal Backend Memory manager is designed to provide an interface
 * for all other MTL_* modules where memory allocation is required.
 *
 * Different allocation strategies and data-structures are used depending
 * on how the data is used by the backend. These aim to optimally handle
 * system memory and abstract away any complexity from the MTL_* modules
 * themselves.
 *
 * There are two primary allocation modes which can be used:
 *
 * ** MTLScratchBufferManager **
 *
 *    Each MTLContext owns a ScratchBufferManager which is implemented
 *    as a pool of circular buffers, designed to handle temporary
 *    memory allocations which occur on a per-frame basis. The scratch
 *    buffers allow flushing of host memory to the GPU to be batched.
 *
 *    Each frame, the next scratch buffer is reset, then later flushed upon
 *    command buffer submission.
 *
 *    Note: This is allocated per-context due to allocations being tied
 *    to workload submissions and context-specific submissions.
 *
 *    Examples of scratch buffer usage are:
 *      - Immediate-mode temporary vertex buffers.
 *      - Shader uniform data updates
 *      - Staging of data for resource copies, or, data reads/writes.
 *
 *  Usage:
 *
 *    MTLContext::get_scratchbuffer_manager() - to fetch active manager.
 *
 *    MTLTemporaryBuffer scratch_buffer_allocate_range(size)
 *    MTLTemporaryBuffer scratch_buffer_allocate_range_aligned(size, align)
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  ** MTLBufferPool **
 *
 *    For static and longer-lasting memory allocations, such as those for UBOs,
 *    Vertex buffers, index buffers, etc; We want an optimal abstraction for
 *    fetching a MTLBuffer of the desired size and resource options.
 *
 *    Memory allocations can be expensive so the MTLBufferPool provides
 *    functionality to track usage of these buffers and once a buffer
 *    is no longer in use, it is returned to the buffer pool for use
 *    by another backend resource.
 *
 *    The MTLBufferPool provides functionality for safe tracking of resources,
 *    as buffers freed on the host side must have their usage by the GPU tracked,
 *    to ensure they are not prematurely re-used before they have finished being
 *    used by the GPU.
 *
 *    Note: The MTLBufferPool is a global construct which can be fetched from anywhere.
 *
 *  Usage:
 *    MTLContext::get_global_memory_manager();  - static routine to fetch global memory manager.
 *
 *    gpu::MTLBuffer *allocate(size, is_cpu_visibile)
 *    gpu::MTLBuffer *allocate_aligned(size, alignment, is_cpu_visibile)
 *    gpu::MTLBuffer *allocate_with_data(size, is_cpu_visibile, data_ptr)
 *    gpu::MTLBuffer *allocate_aligned_with_data(size, alignment, is_cpu_visibile, data_ptr)

/* An MTLSafeFreeList is a temporary list of gpu::MTLBuffers which have

 * the gpu::MTLBuffers can be returned to the Memory manager pools.
 * This list is implemented as a chunked linked-list.
 *
 * Only a single MTLSafeFreeList is active at one time and is associated with current command
 * buffer submissions. If an MTLBuffer is freed during the lifetime of a command buffer, it could
 * still possibly be in-use and as such, the MTLSafeFreeList will increment its reference count for
 * each command buffer submitted while the current pool is active.
 *
 * -- Reference count is incremented upon MTLCommandBuffer commit.
 * -- Reference count is decremented in the MTLCommandBuffer completion callback handler.
 *
 * A new MTLSafeFreeList will begin each render step (frame). This pooling of buffers, rather than
 * individual buffer resource tracking reduces performance overhead.
 *
 *  * The reference count starts at 1 to ensure that the reference count cannot prematurely reach
 *  zero until any command buffers have been submitted. This additional decrement happens
 *  when the next MTLSafeFreeList is created, to allow the existing pool to be released once
 *  the reference count hits zero after submitted command buffers complete.
 *
 * Note: the Metal API independently tracks resources used by command buffers for the purpose of
 * keeping resources alive while in-use by the driver and CPU, however, this differs from the
 * MTLSafeFreeList mechanism in the Metal backend, which exists for the purpose of allowing
 * previously allocated MTLBuffer resources to be re-used. This allows us to save on the expensive
 * cost of memory allocation.
