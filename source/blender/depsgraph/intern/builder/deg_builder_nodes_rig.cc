   *   (ik) solvers live, and are later hooked up (so that they can be
   *   interleaved during runtime) with bone-operations they depend on/affect.
   * - init_pose_eval() and cleanup_pose_eval() are absolute first and last
   *   steps of pose eval process. ALL bone operations must be performed
   *   between these two...
   *
   * Bone Component:
   * - Used for representing each bone within the rig
   * - Acts to encapsulate the evaluation operations (base matrix + parenting,
   *   and constraint stack) so that they can be easily found.
   * - Everything else which depends on bone-results hook up to the component
   *   only so that we can redirect those to point at either the
   *   post-IK/post-constraint/post-matrix steps, as needed. */
