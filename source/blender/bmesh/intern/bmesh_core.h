 * The second region has a new face assigned to it.
 *

 * up to the caller to decide what to do with the extra edge.
 *
 * \note If \a holes is NULL, then both faces will lose
 * all holes from the original face.  Also, you cannot split between
 * a hole vert and a boundary vert; that case is handled by higher-
 * level wrapping functions (when holes are fully implemented, anyway).
