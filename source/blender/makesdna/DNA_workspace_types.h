 * Generic (and simple/primitive) struct for storing a history of assignments/relations

 *
 * Using this we can restore the old state of a workspace if the user switches back to it.
 *
 * Usage
 * =====
 * When activating a workspace, it should activate the screen-layout that was active in that
 * workspace before *in this window*.
 * More concretely:
 * * There are two windows, win1 and win2.
 * * Both show workspace ws1, but both also had workspace ws2 activated at some point before.
 * * Last time ws2 was active in win1, screen-layout sl1 was activated.
 * * Last time ws2 was active in win2, screen-layout sl2 was activated.
 * * When changing from ws1 to ws2 in win1, screen-layout sl1 should be activated again.
 * * When changing from ws1 to ws2 in win2, screen-layout sl2 should be activated again.
 * So that means we have to store the active screen-layout in a per workspace, per window
 * relation. This struct is used to store an active screen-layout for each window within the
 * workspace.
 * To find the screen-layout to activate for this window-workspace combination, simply lookup
 * the WorkSpaceDataRelation with the workspace-hook of the window set as parent.
