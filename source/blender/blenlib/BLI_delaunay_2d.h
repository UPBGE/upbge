/**
 * Interface for Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT) in 2D.
 *
 * The input is a set of vertices, edges between those vertices,
 * and faces using those vertices.
 * Those inputs are called "constraints". The output must contain
 * those constraints, or at least edges, points, and vertices that
 * may be pieced together to form the constraints. Part of the
 * work of doing the CDT is to detect intersections and mergers
 * among the input elements, so these routines are also useful
 * for doing 2D intersection.
 *
 * The output is a triangulation of the plane that includes the
 * constraints in the above sense, and also satisfies the
 * "Delaunay condition" as modified to take into account that
 * the constraints must be there: for every non-constrained edge
 * in the output, there is a circle through the endpoints that
 * does not contain any of the vertices directly connected to
 * those endpoints. What this means in practice is that as
 * much as possible the triangles look "nice" -- not too long
 * and skinny.
 *
 * Optionally, the output can be a subset of the triangulation
 * (but still containing all of the constraints), to get the
 * effect of 2D intersection.
 *
 * The underlying method is incremental, but we need to know
 * beforehand a bounding box for all of the constraints.
 * This code can be extended in the future to allow for
 * deletion of constraints, if there is a use in Blender
 * for dynamically maintaining a triangulation.

/**
 * Input to Constrained Delaunay Triangulation.
 * There are verts_len vertices, whose coordinates
 * are given by vert_coords. For the rest of the input,
 * vertices are referred to by indices into that array.
 * Edges and Faces are optional. If provided, they will
 * appear in the output triangulation ("constraints").
 * One can provide faces and not edges -- the edges
 * implied by the faces will be inferred.
 *
 * The edges are given by pairs of vertex indices.
 * The faces are given in a triple `(faces, faces_start_table, faces_len_table)`
 * to represent a list-of-lists as follows:
 * the vertex indices for a counterclockwise traversal of
 * face number `i` starts at `faces_start_table[i]` and has `faces_len_table[i]`
 * elements.
 *
 * The edges implied by the faces are automatically added
 * and need not be put in the edges array, which is intended
 * as a way to specify edges that are not part of any face.
 *
 * Some notes about some special cases and how they are handled:
 * - Input faces can have any number of vertices greater than 2. Depending
 *   on the output option, ngons may be triangulated or they may remain
 *   as ngons.
 * - Input faces may have repeated vertices. Output faces will not,
 *   except when the CDT_CONSTRAINTS output option is used.
 * - Input faces may have edges that self-intersect, but currently the labeling
 *   of which output faces have which input faces may not be done correctly,
 *   since the labeling relies on the inside being on the left of edges
 *   as one traverses the face. Output faces will not self-intersect.
 * - Input edges, including those implied by the input faces, may have
 *   zero-length or near-zero-length edges (nearness as determined by epsilon),
 *   but those edges will not be in the output.
 * - Input edges (including face edges) can overlap or nearly overlap each other.
 *   The output edges will not overlap, but instead be divided into as many
 *   edges as necessary to represent each overlap regime.
 * - Input vertices may be coincide with, or nearly coincide with (as determined
 *   by epsilon) other input vertices. Only one representative will survive
 *   in the output. If an input vertex is within epsilon of an edge (including
 *   an added triangulation edge), it will be snapped to that edge, so the
 *   output coordinates may not exactly match the input coordinates in all cases.
 * - Wire edges (those not part of faces) and isolated vertices are allowed in
 *   the input. If they are inside faces, they will be incorporated into the
 *   triangulation of those faces.
 *
 * Epsilon is used for "is it near enough" distance calculations.
 * If zero is supplied for epsilon, an internal value of 1e-8 used
 * instead, since this code will not work correctly if it is not allowed
 * to merge "too near" vertices.
 *
 * Normally the output will contain mappings from outputs to inputs.
 * If this is not needed, set need_ids to false and the execution may be much
 * faster in some circumstances.

/**
 * A representation of the triangulation for output.
 * See #CDT_input for the representation of the output
 * vertices, edges, and faces, all represented in
 * a similar way to the input.
 *
 * The output may have merged some input vertices together,
 * if they were closer than some epsilon distance.
 * The output edges may be overlapping sub-segments of some
 * input edges; or they may be new edges for the triangulation.
 * The output faces may be pieces of some input faces, or they
 * may be new.
 *
 * In the same way that faces lists-of-lists were represented by
 * a run-together array and a "start" and "len" extra array,
 * similar triples are used to represent the output to input
 * mapping of vertices, edges, and faces.
 * These are only set if need_ids is true in the input.
 *
 * Those triples are:
 * - verts_orig, verts_orig_start_table, verts_orig_len_table
 * - edges_orig, edges_orig_start_table, edges_orig_len_table
 * - faces_orig, faces_orig_start_table, faces_orig_len_table
 *
 * For edges, the edges_orig triple can also say which original face
 * edge is part of a given output edge. See the comment below
 * on the C++ interface for how to decode the entries in the edges_orig
