/** \file

 *
 * An `Allocator` can allocate and deallocate memory. It is used by containers such as
 * blender::Vector. The allocators defined in this file do not work with standard library
 * containers such as std::vector.
 *
 * Every allocator has to implement two methods:
 *   void *allocate(size_t size, size_t alignment, const char *name);
 *   void deallocate(void *ptr);
 *
 * We don't use the std::allocator interface, because it does more than is really necessary for an
 * allocator and has some other quirks. It mixes the concepts of allocation and construction. It is
 * essentially forced to be a template, even though the allocator should not care about the type.
 * Also see http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2271.html#std_allocator. Some
 * of these aspects have been improved in new versions of C++, so we might have to reevaluate the
 * strategy later on.
 *
 * The allocator interface dictated by this file is very simplistic, but for now that is all we
 * need. More complexity can be added when it seems necessary.
