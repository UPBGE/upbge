 *
 * A `FunctionRef<Signature>` is a non-owning reference to some callable object with a specific
 * signature. It can be used to pass some callback to another function.
 *
 * A `FunctionRef` is small and cheap to copy. Therefore it should generally be passed by value.
 *
 * Example signatures:
 *   `FunctionRef<void()>`        - A function without parameters and void return type.
 *   `FunctionRef<int(float)>`    - A function with a float parameter and an int return value.
 *   `FunctionRef<int(int, int)>` - A function with two int parameters and an int return value.
 *
 * There are multiple ways to achieve that, so here is a comparison of the different approaches:
 * 1. Pass function pointer and user data (as void *) separately:
 *    - The only method that is compatible with C interfaces.
 *    - Is cumbersome to work with in many cases, because one has to keep track of two parameters.
 *    - Not type safe at all, because of the void pointer.
 *    - It requires workarounds when one wants to pass a lambda into a function.
 * 2. Using `std::function`:
 *    - It works well with most callables and is easy to use.
 *    - Owns the callable, so it can be returned from a function more safely than other methods.
 *    - Requires that the callable is copyable.
 *    - Requires an allocation when the callable is too large (typically > 16 bytes).
 * 3. Using a template for the callable type:
 *    - Most efficient solution at runtime, because compiler knows the exact callable at the place
 *      where it is called.
 *    - Works well with all callables.
 *    - Requires the function to be in a header file.
 *    - It's difficult to constrain the signature of the function.
 * 4. Using `FunctionRef`:
 *    - Second most efficient solution at runtime.
 *    - It's easy to constrain the signature of the callable.
 *    - Does not require the function to be in a header file.
 *    - Works well with all callables.
 *    - It's a non-owning reference, so it *cannot* be stored safely in general.
 *
 * The fact that this is a non-owning reference makes `FunctionRef` very well suited for some use
 * cases, but one has to be a bit more careful when using it to make sure that the referenced
 * callable is not destructed.
 *
 * In particular, one must not construct a `FunctionRef` variable from a lambda directly as shown
 * below. This is because the lambda object goes out of scope after the line finished executing and
 * will be destructed. Calling the reference afterwards invokes undefined behavior.
 *
 * Don't:
 *   FunctionRef<int()> ref = []() { return 0; };
 * Do:
 *   auto f = []() { return 0; };
 *   FuntionRef<int()> ref = f;
 *
 * It is fine to pass a lambda directly to a function:
 *
 *   void some_function(FunctionRef<int()> f);
 *   some_function([]() { return 0; });
