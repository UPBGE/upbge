 * \note dials act similar to old rotation based phones and output an angle.
 *
 * They just are initialized with the center of the dial and a threshold value as input.
 *
 * When the distance of the current position of the dial from the center
 * exceeds the threshold, this position is used to calculate the initial direction.
 * After that, the angle from the initial direction is calculated based on
 * current and previous directions of the digit, and returned to the user.
 *
 * Usage examples:
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * float start_position[2] = {0.0f, 0.0f};
 * float current_position[2];
 * float threshold = 0.5f;
 * float angle;
 * Dial *dial;
 *
 * dial = BLI_dial_init(start_position, threshold);
 *
 * angle = BLI_dial_angle(dial, current_position);
 *
 * MEM_freeN(dial);
 * \endcode
