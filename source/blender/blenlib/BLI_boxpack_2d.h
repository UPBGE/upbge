 * Packs boxes into a fixed area.
 *
 * Boxes and packed are linked lists containing structs that can be cast to
 * #FixedSizeBoxPack (i.e. contains a #FixedSizeBoxPack as its first element).
 * Boxes that were packed successfully are placed into *packed and removed from *boxes.
 *
 * The algorithm is a simplified version of https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/rectpack2D.
 * Better ones could be used, but for the current use case (packing Image tiles into GPU
 * textures) this is fine.
 *
 * Note that packing efficiency depends on the order of the input boxes. Generally speaking,
 * larger boxes should come first, though how exactly size is best defined (e.g. area, perimeter)
 * depends on the particular application.
