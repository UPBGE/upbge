 *
 * This file implements different probing strategies. Those can be used by different hash table
 * implementations like blender::Set and blender::Map. A probing strategy produces a sequence of
 * values based on an initial hash value.
 *
 * A probing strategy has to implement the following methods:
 * - Constructor(uint64_t hash): Start a new probing sequence based on the given hash.
 * - get() const -> uint64_t: Get the current value in the sequence.
 * - next() -> void: Update the internal state, so that the next value can be accessed with get().
 * - linear_steps() -> int64_t: Returns number of linear probing steps that should be done.
 *
 * Using linear probing steps between larger jumps can result in better performance, due to
 * improved cache usage. It's a way of getting the benefits or linear probing without the
 * clustering issues. However, more linear steps can also make things slower when the initial hash
 * produces many collisions.
 *
 * Every probing strategy has to guarantee, that every possible uint64_t is returned eventually.
 * This is necessary for correctness. If this is not the case, empty slots might not be found.
 *
 * The SLOT_PROBING_BEGIN and SLOT_PROBING_END macros can be used to implement a loop that iterates
 * over a probing sequence.
 *
 * Probing strategies can be evaluated with many different criteria. Different use cases often
 * have different optimal strategies. Examples:
 * - If the hash function generates a well distributed initial hash value, the constructor should
 *   be as short as possible. This is because the hash value can be used as slot index almost
 *   immediately, without too many collisions. This is also a perfect use case for linear steps.
 * - If the hash function is bad, it can help if the probing strategy remixes the hash value,
 *   before the first slot is accessed.
 * - Different next() methods can remix the hash value in different ways. Depending on which bits
 *   of the hash value contain the most information, different rehashing strategies work best.
 * - When the hash table is very small, having a trivial hash function and then doing linear
 *   probing might work best.
