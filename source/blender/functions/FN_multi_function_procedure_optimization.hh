 * A #MFProcedure optimization pass takes an existing procedure and changes it in a way that
 * improves its performance when executed.
 *
 * Oftentimes it would also be possible to implement a specific optimization directly during
 * construction of the initial #MFProcedure. There is a trade-off between doing that or just
 * building a "simple" procedure and then optimizing it uses separate optimization passes.
 * - Doing optimizations directly during construction is typically faster than doing it as a
 *   separate pass. However, it would be much harder to turn the optimization off when it is not
 *   necessary, making the construction potentially slower in those cases.
 * - Doing optimizations directly would also make code more complex, because it mixes the logic
 *   that generates the procedure from some other data with optimization decisions.
 * - Having a separate pass allows us to use it in different places when necessary.
 * - Having a separate pass allows us to enable and disable it easily to better understand its
 *   impact on performance.

/**
 * When generating a procedure, destruct instructions (#MFDestructInstruction) have to be inserted
 * for all variables that are not outputs. Often the simplest approach is to add these instructions
 * at the very end. However, when the procedure is executed this is not optimal, because many more
 * variables are initialized at the same time than necessary. This inhibits the reuse of memory
 * buffers which decreases performance and increases memory use.
 *
 * This optimization pass moves destruct instructions up in the procedure. The goal is to destruct
 * each variable right after its last use.
 *
 * For simplicity, and because this is the most common use case, this optimization currently only
 * works on a single chain of instructions. Destruct instructions are not moved across branches.
 *
 * \param procedure: The procedure that should be optimized.
 * \param block_end_instr: The instruction that points to the last instruction within a linear
 * chain of instructions. The algorithm moves instructions backward starting at this instruction.
